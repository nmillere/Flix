### Notes (Part 2)
I ran into issues when I was attempting to use the Genre API to list the genres rather than the genre ids of the movie. What I learned was that I needed to not put code after the client get method, because there ends up being a race condition and the variables kept being null. After I put the code that needed the genres within the client method I didn't have any issues. I got stuck on this for a while.

Having multiple viewholders made some of the stretch goals more difficult to accomplish.

   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [x] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
I had the most difficulty implementing the different views depending on whether the movie was popular or not.
